            <p>Flexicalymene, a species of trilobite come from the Ktaoua Formation 
                in Morocco North Africa and date back to 450 million years ago of the

            <p> Geologists use trilobites in a variety of ways to help them understand 
                how the Earth has developed. One use is in the relative dating and stratigraphical 
                correlation of sedimentary rock successions and also to reconstructing past geographies 
                (palaeogeography) and past environments (palaeoenvironments)</p>
